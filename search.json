Mild weather delays are not counted in the “Weather” category, but are actually included in both the “NAS” and “Late-Arriving Aircraft” categories. Your job is to create a new column that calculates the total number of flights delayed by weather (both severe and mild). You will need to replace all the missing values in the Late Aircraft variable with the mean. Show your work by printing the first 5 rows of data in a table. Use these three rules for your calculations:\n100% of delayed flights in the Weather category are due to weather\n30% of all delayed flights in the Late-Arriving category are due to weather.\nFrom April to August, 40% of delayed flights in the NAS category are due to weather. The rest of the months, the proportion rises to 65%\nThis shows the columns that calculates the total number of flights delayed by weather. There are two conditions where the flights gets delayed - sever and mild. NAS and Late-Arriving Aircraft includes mild weather delays as well.
